### **I performed a multiple regression analysis on the missing BMI data to complement it.**

The implementation code and the data I used are as follows:

* **</span>README.md</span>** : Overview of this repository

* **Missing_data_completion.py** : Code that implements a method to complement BMI values using multiple regression analysis.

* **blood_test_data.csv** : Blood test data (with missing data)

* **blood_test_data_edited.csv** : Numeric converted blood test data (with missing values)

* **result** : A directory containing the results of multiple regression analysis. The results are stored separately in the directory for the results with/without dummy variables, and for the results with/without Smoke and Drink values.
